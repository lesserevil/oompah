## Summary

Triggered by: OOMPAH-737

Regression of OOMPAH-737/OOMPAH-350 observed live on 2026-08-09 while the 1,776-issue workflow reconciliation was active. The service kept PID 2715559 and port 8090 but /api/v1/state and /healthz returned no bytes; make graceful and make status timed out. After scheduler CPU stopped, the sole process remained indefinitely blocked in futex_do_wait. The documented emergency make force-restart also could not recover because canonical_cli_cutover required a responsive old /healthz, and identity-checked make stop sent SIGTERM but the process did not exit within 30 seconds. No worker child processes existed; recovery required verifying PID/cwd/process-group identity, SIGKILLing that exact service group, and make start. Implementation scope: reproduce a large/current workflow reconciliation that wedges scheduler/control-plane shutdown; identify and remove the remaining cross-thread/event-loop/GIL/deadlock path; keep /healthz, /api/v1/state, quiesce, restart-claim/cancel, and graceful/force lifecycle control responsive; and provide an identity-safe bounded emergency recovery when the old HTTP control plane is unresponsive. Preserve agent draining and never kill unverified processes. Relevant areas: scheduler thread isolation, workflow reconciliation/state publication, server shutdown, scripts/canonical_cli_cutover.py, Makefile lifecycle targets, and process identity. Required tests: blocked reconciliation cannot delay health/state/quiesce; graceful restart cuts over; emergency force-restart can recover a verified unresponsive old service without an HTTP precondition; SIGTERM shutdown is bounded; reused/wrong PID identity is refused; active-agent normal drain semantics remain intact. Acceptance: deterministic regressions pass, focused scheduler/restart/workflow suites and full gate pass, and a live large-corpus reconciliation remains controllable and restarts cleanly.

Direct owner recovery/implementation claimed after live reproduction. Exact incident: verified service PID 2715559, no worker children, all HTTP lifecycle calls timed out, force-restart could not pass old-health precondition, SIGTERM stop exceeded 30 seconds, exact process group required SIGKILL, and make start recovered exact build 312c18ae3.

Additional post-restart liveness evidence: after generation 852 finished, SQLite had zero running jobs, but /api/v1/state continued to report workflow_runtime.worker active=3, retained=3, shared active lanes=3 and last admission repeatedly processed/scheduled zero. A priority-0 direct_owner_claim for OOMPAH-975 remained queued despite two explicit POST /api/v1/refresh requests. All worker/reconcile threads were sleeping; no new full tick published after 21:14:24. The fix must reconcile retained in-memory calls with terminal/exhausted durable rows and preserve the reserved control slot so priority-0 owner/lifecycle control cannot be starved by orphaned shared effects.
