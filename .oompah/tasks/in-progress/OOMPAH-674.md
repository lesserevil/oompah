## Summary

Bug follow-up to OOMPAH-670. The dashboard normally initializes from /ws, but websocket_endpoint sends _cached_state_snapshot_or_unavailable() directly while /api/v1/state augments the snapshot with http_auth. Therefore a fresh authenticated dashboard keeps httpAuthEnabled=false and status mutations include actor_login, which the authenticated server correctly rejects as actor_mismatch. Implementation scope: centralize and enrich public state snapshots so REST and every WebSocket state message include the same redacted build, service, and auth metadata; ensure no credentials or secret material can enter the payload. Add regression tests that exercise initial WebSocket state and refresh state under HTTP Basic auth and prove the dashboard status mutation omits client-supplied actor identity. Acceptance criteria: authenticated drag/drop and status changes succeed without actor_mismatch; REST and WebSocket expose consistent redacted http_auth.enabled; unauthenticated deployments preserve compatibility; focused tests and the configured Makefile gate pass.
