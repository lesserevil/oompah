## Summary

### Problem
Oompah detected a backend error from `backend:checkpoint_queue`:

> Checkpoint flush FAILED (reason=debounce); push_failures=1

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run oompah with `backend:checkpoint_queue` active.
2. Let oompah operate on the `proj-14849f1b` project (tracker: `provenanceguardedtracker`).
3. Observe that the error is captured by `error_watcher` and auto-filed as this task.

### Actual Behavior
An error occurs in `backend:checkpoint_queue` and is recorded by oompah's `error_watcher`:

> Checkpoint flush FAILED (reason=debounce); push_failures=1

### Expected Behavior
The operation in `backend:checkpoint_queue` should complete successfully, or degrade gracefully with a clear actionable message. No unhandled error should be auto-filed as a task during normal operation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The error from `backend:checkpoint_queue` no longer occurs, or is handled gracefully so `error_watcher` is not triggered.
- The root cause is identified and resolved, or documented as a known acceptable failure with explicit handling.
- No regression: other error types continue to be reported correctly by `error_watcher`.

Override by oompah-cli: terminal transition to Archived applied by project owner.

Reason: Operator consolidation of an auto-filed retry artifact into canonical defects OOMPAH-1127 and OOMPAH-1128 after recovering and publishing the affected Trickle state history.

Archived as a duplicate retry artifact. The stale checkpoint-writer defect is tracked by OOMPAH-1127 and the auto-filing deduplication defect by OOMPAH-1128. The affected state history was recovered and fast-forwarded to GitLab at d6b89313f65b8b018a254e23cfb4510482338479.
