## Summary

Goal

Finish aggressive but safe worktree/branch pruning and remove maintenance errors/noise that obscure real faults. Reuse OOMPAH-581, preserve dirty or unmerged work, repair project-scoped merged-label maintenance, and make cleanup outcomes measurable.

Relevant context

The managed oompah repository retained 20 registered worktrees, 117 local branches, and 67 remote branches. Cleanup itself reported no fatal error, but emitted repeated terminal-branch ownership warnings and a slow tick; merged_labels rejected OOMPAH-476 for missing project_id. OOMPAH-581 is already implemented and Ready to Integrate.

Acceptance criteria

Safe terminal artifacts are pruned on schedule; dirty/unmerged/shared-owner work is preserved; ownership skips are aggregated instead of warning-flooded; cleanup latency and categorized skip counts are visible; merged-label maintenance always resolves project scope without unsafe legacy fallback; focused and complete gates pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.
