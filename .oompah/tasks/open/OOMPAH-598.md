## Summary

Implementation scope

Add reconciliation for standalone tasks whose tracker state is Ready to Integrate and whose branch is pushed, but which have neither an active integration execution nor an open PR. Select the configured delivery mechanism deterministically, enqueue/open it idempotently, and alert on genuinely undeliverable rows. Recover the current OOMPAH-574, OOMPAH-575, OOMPAH-576, and OOMPAH-581 rows. Do not create duplicate PRs or bypass the configured full gate. Relevant areas include landing reconciliation, integration queue, review creation, webhook state, and release-delivery status.

Tests

Cover pushed standalone branch, missing branch, existing open/closed PR, existing queue row, duplicate ticks, restart, gate failure/retry, and successful merge/audit. Run focused tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

A pushed standalone Ready task cannot remain invisible with no PR/queue activity beyond the reconciliation interval; all four current rows obtain a valid delivery path or explicit actionable failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.

Coordination: OOMPAH-593 exclusively owns delivery/live verification of OOMPAH-575. After OOMPAH-593 completes, this task owns stranded-ready reconciliation and delivery for OOMPAH-574, OOMPAH-576, and OOMPAH-581 plus the generic watchdog fix; do not duplicate OOMPAH-575 work.
