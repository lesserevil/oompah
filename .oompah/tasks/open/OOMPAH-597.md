## Summary

Implementation scope

Using the normal repair and integration mechanisms, resolve the current branch conflicts for OOMPAH-484 and OOMPAH-487 against the latest epic/main base, preserve both tasks intent and tests, and drain OOMPAH-485, OOMPAH-488, and OOMPAH-489 in dependency order. Reconcile the auxiliary OOMPAH-580 task through the terminal-audit path. Do not bypass quality gates, terminal audits, or edit task Markdown directly. File narrowly scoped follow-ups for any newly discovered code defect.

Tests

Run focused tests for each resolved conflict, the complete epic branch gate on the exact review-ready head, and live queue/audit verification.

Acceptance criteria

The five Ready children reach Done with integrated SHAs and passing audits, no queue row remains blocked/ready without progress, and epic OOMPAH-460 can advance through its normal PR/merge lifecycle.
