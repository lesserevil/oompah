## Summary

Implementation scope: harden task submission and integration worktree preparation so a submission made from the service/default-branch checkout cannot overwrite an existing task's recorded work branch or reset that task's live worktree to origin/main. Validate that the submitted local branch matches the task's expected work-branch namespace and pushed remote head before updating the queue; make integration worktree preparation fail closed when the queue branch disagrees with an already-registered worktree branch, without running reset. Relevant context/files: oompah/task_cli.py submit payload construction, server submit endpoint, oompah/integration_queue.py, oompah/integration_executor.py, and ProjectStore worktree preparation. Regression observed on OOMPAH-483: submitting from /home/shedwards/src/oompah queued task_branch=main, then the executor reset the registered epic-OOMPAH-459--task-OOMPAH-483 worktree from bc448cf08 to origin/main; the remote branch preserved the work and an operator restored it by fast-forward. Tests: cover wrong-checkout submit rejection, unchanged queue record, unchanged registered task worktree HEAD/branch, correct task-worktree resubmission, and no destructive reset on branch mismatch. Acceptance criteria: wrong-checkout submission returns an actionable error before tracker/queue/worktree mutation; correct submissions still integrate; a malformed/stale queue row cannot rewrite a registered worktree.
