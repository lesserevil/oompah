## Summary

Live race reproduced on OOMPAH-655 at 2026-07-31 11:03-11:06 UTC: a full gate launched for submitted head 2713e14ea continued in the task's reusable worktree after operator rejection/reopen, while the replacement implementation agent modified oompah/quality_gate.py and tests in that same worktree. Pytest therefore read a moving mixture that did not correspond to the recorded head, yet the result could still be consumed as exact-head evidence. Implementation scope: change the server-owned quality-gate/integration launch path and worktree lifecycle so every gate executes from an immutable snapshot of the recorded commit (dedicated detached worktree, archive, or equivalent), with the checked-out SHA verified before spawn; prevent task worktree reassignment/mutation from affecting an active gate; tie cancellation and process-group cleanup to the exact gate generation; and discard results when task/head/generation is no longer current. Relevant code includes oompah/quality_gate.py, integration/review orchestration, worktree allocation/cleanup, and their tests. Add deterministic barrier tests that start a gate, reopen and edit/reassign the normal task worktree, then prove the gate sees only its recorded head; cover old/new head gates overlapping, cancellation/rejection before completion, stale success never creating a review/integration, exact owned-descendant cleanup, and snapshot cleanup without pruning active evidence. Acceptance: a gate result is cryptographically/topologically attributable to one immutable commit, mutable task worktrees can never change its inputs, stale generations have no state effect, and focused tests plus make test pass.
