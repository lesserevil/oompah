## Summary

### Problem
Oompah detected a backend error from `backend:orchestrator`:

> Orchestrator shutdown attempt failed; retaining process and retrying

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run oompah with `backend:orchestrator` active.
2. Let oompah operate on the `proj-14849f1b` project (tracker: `provenanceguardedtracker`).
3. Observe that the error is captured by `error_watcher` and auto-filed as this task.

### Actual Behavior
An error occurs in `backend:orchestrator` and is recorded by oompah's `error_watcher`:

> Orchestrator shutdown attempt failed; retaining process and retrying

### Expected Behavior
The operation in `backend:orchestrator` should complete successfully, or degrade gracefully with a clear actionable message. No unhandled error should be auto-filed as a task during normal operation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The error from `backend:orchestrator` no longer occurs, or is handled gracefully so `error_watcher` is not triggered.
- The root cause is identified and resolved, or documented as a known acceptable failure with explicit handling.
- No regression: other error types continue to be reported correctly by `error_watcher`.
