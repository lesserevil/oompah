## Summary

Implementation scope

Track counters/gauges for queued, running, passed, failed, retried, stale-discarded, overridden, grandfathered, and no-independent-candidate audits, plus oldest queue age and last successful audit time. Surface them in the existing snapshot/maintenance status shapes. Add dashboard alerts only when no independent candidate exists, an audit exceeds the configured attempt/age threshold, queue recovery fails, or persistence is corrupt. Deduplicate by project/task/audit and clear alerts on recovery. Normal queued/running/passed audits must not alert.

Tests

Use deterministic clocks to cover metric increments, restart restoration, per-project isolation, oldest age, alert threshold/dedup/clear, no-candidate instructions, corrupt persistence, and absence of normal-operation alerts. Run observability tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

Operators can distinguish healthy validation throughput from an actionable audit stall without receiving routine operating-procedure noise.
