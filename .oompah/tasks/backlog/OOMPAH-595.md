## Summary

Implementation scope

Add safe health probes and alerts that distinguish operator Basic-auth configuration drift from scoped task-handoff capability failures. Count/redact 401 and 403 outcomes by authentication path, report whether a worker token was minted and accepted without reporting the token, and provide actionable operator guidance. Avoid alerting on intentional unrelated-task denial. Relevant files include task_handoff instrumentation, task CLI/server middleware, service health/alerts APIs, dashboard, and docs troubleshooting.

Tests

Cover healthy operator and worker paths, stale operator credentials, missing/expired worker token, intentional scope denial, alert clear after recovery, restart persistence where appropriate, and redaction. Run focused auth/health/UI tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

Operators can tell which authentication plane failed and how to recover it; secrets/capabilities never appear in logs, state JSON, alerts, or task comments.
