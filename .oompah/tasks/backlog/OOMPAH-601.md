## Summary

Implementation scope

Correct and consolidate aggressive cleanup handling for terminal child tasks that legitimately share an epic-owned branch. Resolve ownership through canonical task/epic aliases before deciding, preserve ambiguous/shared branches, and emit one structured summary per run with categorized counts instead of one warning per child every tick. Keep actionable corruption/unsafe-path cases as warnings or alerts. Measure and avoid the observed multi-second reconciliation slowdown. Relevant files include oompah/projects.py cleanup/ownership helpers, orchestrator maintenance status, and logs/state APIs.

Tests

Cover shared epic branches, task-style repair branches, aliases, missing project_id, cross-project same identifiers, dirty/unmerged branches, large batches, warning aggregation, and latency-safe bounded scans. Run focused cleanup tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

Normal shared-branch ownership produces no warning flood, cleanup remains safe, categorized skip evidence is visible, and the maintenance tick stays within its configured healthy budget for representative inventory.
