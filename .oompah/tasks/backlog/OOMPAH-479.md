## Summary

Implementation scope

Inventory and replace Merged writes driven by GitHub/GitLab merge webhooks, YOLO direct/queued merge outcomes, merged-label maintenance, deferred Done review reconciliation, stale In Review reconciliation, and branch-containment sweeps. Each authoritative merge signal requests Merged with review/source/target evidence. If no current Done audit exists, the coordinator chains Done then Merged. Physical merges may already have occurred, but tracker state remains In Validation until both contracts pass. Preserve CI/rebase recovery and wrong-target checks.

Tests

Add provider-neutral webhook/YOLO/reconciliation cases for correct merge, direct Merged without Done, duplicate webhook/poll events, wrong target, failed/pending CI, deleted source branch, source advanced after merge, shared epic branch, and no matching task. Assert no direct terminal tracker call. Run focused tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

Every forge- or Git-observed landing is independently validated before the task/epic says Merged, while duplicate observations remain idempotent.
