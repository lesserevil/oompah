## Summary

Plan reference: plans/gitlab-forge-parity.md, GitLab implementation.

Implement GitLab pipeline/job lookup for branch heads, commit SHAs, and MRs using the forge-neutral CI contract. Normalize pipeline/job outcomes to passed, failed, pending, or unknown; include bounded actionable warnings and job/pipeline URLs. Support self-managed GitLab API bases.

Do not wire orchestration behavior in this task; expose provider methods and tests only.

Tests:
- Success, failure, canceled, skipped, running, pending, no-pipeline, forbidden, rate-limited, and malformed-response fixtures.
- Multiple pipeline/job aggregation and deterministic warning ordering.
- Contract parity assertions against the GitHub CI result shape.

Acceptance criteria:
- Callers can determine GitLab CI state for a MR, branch, or commit without parsing provider payloads.
- Unavailable CI permissions are visible as capability warnings, not false success.
- make test passes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.
