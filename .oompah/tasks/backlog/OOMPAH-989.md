## Summary

Triggered by: OOMPAH-986

Live regression on 2026-08-10 while deploying OOMPAH-986: make graceful acquired the restart claim against healthy revision 148db44a97e42140160a428bd11eed2c50f75381, then POST /api/v1/orchestrator/quiesce timed out. The server stopped answering /healthz and /api/v1/state for several minutes, logged no progress after 06:08:42 UTC, and slept on futex_do_wait. The cutover could not cancel its restart claim because that POST also timed out, requiring the identity-checked make force-restart recovery. The last authoritative snapshot had zero agents and auditors; only durable workflow jobs existed. Diagnose and eliminate any event-loop blocking/deadlock across the quiesce/restart-claim path, workflow publication, issue snapshot refresh, and webhook handling. Relevant code: server lifecycle endpoints, orchestrator quiesce/drain, scripts/canonical_cli_cutover.py, workflow_runtime publication/drain coordination, and lifecycle tests. Add a deterministic regression that holds slow/full-project workflow or snapshot work while a graceful restart claims and quiesces; prove /healthz and lifecycle control requests remain responsive, the quiesce request returns within its HTTP budget, cancellation/resume remains possible after a pre-cutover failure, no agent is interrupted before drain authority permits it, and restart reaches the exact new build without force. Also cover a dropped/timed-out response after server-side acceptance so the client and server converge without an orphaned restart fence. Acceptance: make graceful cannot wedge the HTTP control plane; bounded failures leave the old service responsive and unquiesced or complete an exactly identified cutover; focused lifecycle/runtime/server tests and the full Makefile gate pass.
