## Summary

Implementation scope

Replace terminal writes in epic rollup reconciliation, stale In Review child completion, parent auto-close, and epic/child merged promotion with coordinator requests. In Validation children count as nonterminal and block rollup landing. A parent cannot enter Done until every required child has a current passed Done audit. A parent Merged request must chain its own Done audit when missing and then run target landing audit. Preserve nested/shared epic branch and landing-evidence gates. Do not let rollup reconciliation overwrite In Validation or audit:repair-needed.

Tests

Cover standalone epic, shared children, stale In Review child to Done, nested epics, child In Validation blocking parent, missing child audit, parent Done/Merged audit chains, independently merged child, existing review-repair states, and idempotent repeated ticks. Run epic strategy/rollup tests and make test.

Acceptance criteria

No epic or child is terminalized by rollup alone; each terminal meaning has the correct current audit and existing branch containment safeguards still apply.
