## Summary

Follow-up to incomplete OOMPAH-428 after parent epic OOMPAH-426 and PR #544 merged. Implement the remaining defense-in-depth for shared-epic children. Scope: ensure _ensure_review_exists blocks per-child PR creation even when work_branch is stale to the child identifier; fail closed when parent_id is absent in a partial issue but a parent epic is authoritatively resolvable; verify _create_workspace_for_issue always corrects the in-memory work/branch identity before routing even if metadata persistence fails; and ensure independently merged reconciliation detects a child whose own stale work_branch bypassed its epic. Relevant files: oompah/orchestrator.py, tests/test_epic_strategy.py, and independently-merged reconciliation tests. Required regressions: stale own work_branch with parent_id; missing parent_id but resolvable parent; persistence failure still corrects memory; EXOCOMP-57-style independently merged child detection. Acceptance: no child-to-main PR can be created through these pre-merge edge cases, the invalid merged-child path is actionable, focused epic strategy tests and terminal mutation scan pass, and make test passes.
