## Summary

Live regression after deploying OOMPAH-725 on 2026-08-03. During resume, terminal lifecycle enforcement demoted many historical shared/nested epic children from Merged to Done with 'parent epic ... could not be verified'. OOMPAH-587 and OOMPAH-588 are concrete false positives: both have durable PASS/Merged audits and reviewed merge commits into parent OOMPAH-584; OOMPAH-584 itself has a PASS/Merged audit proving PR #603 landed merge commit bb0fd760c3b2938d15ec2026ef5bfc2fd34b0682 on main. The parent source branch was normally deleted after merge. Nevertheless enforcement demoted the children, and ordinary reconciliation then resurrected OOMPAH-587 into In Validation and OOMPAH-588 into In Review, consuming reviews/auditors for already delivered work.\n\nImplementation scope:\n- Make shared/nested child Merged compatibility validation recognize durable parent landing evidence: recorded parent review/merge commit, terminal PASS/Merged audit, exact merge parents/ancestry, and configured target branch, even when the parent source branch was deleted normally.\n- Separate 'cannot currently fetch deleted source ref' from 'parent has not landed'; fail closed only when durable evidence is absent or contradictory.\n- Order startup/restart reconciliation so parent evidence is loaded before children are classified, or defer uncertain rows without mutating tracker state until verification completes.\n- Never demote a verified historical Merged task merely because caches, remote refs, or startup scans are temporarily incomplete.\n- Keep OOMPAH-725's intended repair for truly incompatible Merged children whose parent has not landed.\n- Avoid redispatching reviews/audits or reopening later shared-branch siblings as a consequence of a false demotion; preserve OOMPAH-447 ownership fencing.\n\nRelevant code: terminal_audit_enforcement legacy lifecycle reconciliation, shared-epic lifecycle validator and _epic_branch_landed_on_target, terminal audit/review evidence loading, startup ordering, and terminal/open-review reconciliation. Related tasks: OOMPAH-725, OOMPAH-726, OOMPAH-447.\n\nRequired tests:\n- Reproduce OOMPAH-584/587/588: nested child reviewed into parent, parent reviewed into main, both audits PASS/Merged, both source branches deleted; restart enforcement must retain all Merged states with zero new review/audit.\n- Cover merge-commit and fast-forward landing, patch-equivalent rebased parent head, deleted child and parent refs, stale/missing cache with authoritative forge evidence available, and transient forge failure.\n- Prove a genuinely unlanded parent still causes the OOMPAH-725 Merged-to-Done repair exactly once.\n- Prove a later open PR reusing the shared branch does not reopen unrelated siblings (OOMPAH-447 regression).\n- Run focused terminal enforcement, epic strategy, review ownership, deleted-branch recovery, startup/restart, and lifecycle suites plus make test.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Verified nested epics such as OOMPAH-587 and OOMPAH-588 remain Merged across restart after normal branch deletion.\n- Uncertain verification never mutates terminal tracker state until authoritative evidence resolves.\n- Truly incompatible Merged children still converge safely to audited Done without losing history.
