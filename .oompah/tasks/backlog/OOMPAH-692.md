## Summary

Implement the server-side ordering and freshness contract for dashboard WebSocket data.

Scope:
- Define a documented envelope version with the existing service_instance_id as the stream epoch, a contiguous per-connection delivery sequence, and monotonic authoritative revisions for state and issue snapshots.
- Advance the state revision whenever _update_state_snapshot accepts a newer orchestrator snapshot, including callbacks whose immediate broadcast is throttled. Advance the issue revision whenever an issue snapshot is invalidated/rebuilt.
- Include protocol version, epoch, delivery sequence, state revision, and issue revision as applicable on bootstrap, state, issues, activity, pong, and error/control messages without breaking existing authenticated clients.
- Make counters concurrency-safe across observer threads and the API event loop; define restart/reset and reconnect semantics explicitly in plans/ or adjacent protocol documentation.
- Replace pure leading-edge state dropping with trailing-edge coalescing, or otherwise guarantee that the latest cached snapshot is eventually broadcast when clients remain connected.

Relevant files: oompah/server.py observer/broadcast/cache code, oompah/orchestrator.py notification paths, protocol documentation under plans/, and tests/test_ws_lifecycle.py.

Required tests:
- Multiple authoritative mutations inside the throttle window advance revisions monotonically even if payload broadcasts coalesce.
- The final coalesced state is eventually emitted with the latest revision.
- Per-connection delivery sequences are contiguous and isolated from bootstrap sends to other clients.
- Epoch/revision reset behavior is deterministic across service-instance changes.
- Concurrent callbacks cannot duplicate or regress revisions.

Acceptance criteria:
- The server never labels stale state with a current revision.
- A client can distinguish transport-message gaps from authoritative state-generation gaps.
- Existing WebSocket fan-out, authentication, console, and issue-throttle tests remain green.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.
