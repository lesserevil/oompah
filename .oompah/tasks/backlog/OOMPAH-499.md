## Summary

Implementation scope

Remove proven one-off duplicates and resolve Python name shadowing in the test sources. Delete or merge the duplicate empty approval case in `tests/test_intake_approval.py`, shared-strategy assertion in `tests/test_epic_strategy.py`, empty-candidate validation in `tests/test_role_store.py`, no-policy shell assertion in `tests/test_authority_boundary.py`, exception-hierarchy copies in `tests/test_error_watcher.py`, and any equally exact clone confirmed by AST comparison. In `tests/test_label_auth.py`, remove the earlier duplicate `test_proposed` definitions. In `tests/test_orchestrator_merged.py`, compare both definitions of `TestProjectHasOpenReview` and `TestDispatchSerializationByProject`; merge any unique case into the surviving class, then remove the shadowed class bodies. In `tests/test_epic_strategy.py`, the two same-named dirty-worktree methods exercise different inputs, so rename or merge the intended unique `.oompah/tasks` case instead of blindly deleting it. Resolve the duplicate `_FakeProjectStore` helper in `tests/test_webhooks.py` with one unambiguous helper name.

Tests

Add a small AST-based test or repository check that fails when a module or class body defines the same test name twice. Run every changed file, then `--collect-only` to prove intended formerly shadowed cases are actually collected. Run `make test`.

Acceptance criteria

No test module contains shadowed test classes/methods, no unique intended case remains dead, the named exact duplicates are removed, and the duplicate-name guard produces an actionable file, line, scope, and symbol on failure.
