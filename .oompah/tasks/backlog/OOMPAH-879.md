## Summary

Live reproduction 2026-08-07: OOMPAH-877 already represented the required epic-OOMPAH-763 rebase and was under an active direct-owner claim while waiting for Ready child heads OOMPAH-854@91e76723e and OOMPAH-866@f959c1827 to integrate. The stale-epic scheduler nevertheless auto-filed and dispatched duplicate OOMPAH-878 against the same epic generation and clean shared epic worktree at 04fa678, which would have published an obsolete rebase before those children landed. Implementation scope: make rebase filing/dispatch an atomic per-project+epic+target-generation decision; treat every nonterminal rebase task, active owner claim, running generation, and durable rebase job as mutually exclusive authority; re-evaluate prerequisites and epic head immediately before worker admission and before push; archive/supersede duplicate auto-filed tasks without provider work. Relevant code: epic staleness/rebase filing, duplicate preflight qualification, direct-owner admission, durable workflow jobs, and shared epic worktree fencing. Required tests: a claimed existing rebase prevents a second filing and dispatch; concurrent staleness ticks yield one task; a newly integrated child invalidates an older rebase generation before push; restart preserves exclusivity; a genuinely new main/epic generation can file exactly one successor after prior terminal completion. Acceptance: at most one actionable rebase authority exists per epic generation, and no stale duplicate can mutate or publish the epic branch.
